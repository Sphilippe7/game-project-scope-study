# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
I plan to use an SPA to make the game fluid and smooth. So that means it will be
in JSON format

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

-   How you plan to approach this project.
What I'm doing now is just thinking of and going back to the ways in which we
learned how to start this project. The wireframe is already done so I just have
to go over notes and pick the best options that will help me make a good game.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
 As a user I want to be able to make a username
 As a user I want to be able to quit the game when I choose
 As a user I want to be able to keep track of my wins
 As a user I want to be able to rematch my opponent

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
Well one of the spins I added to my game that hasn't been taught is putting a
countdown for players to make a move. I'm not sure if we will learn how to do this
in class but I want it to be part of my game

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
- No I do not plan to attempt the bonuses

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
